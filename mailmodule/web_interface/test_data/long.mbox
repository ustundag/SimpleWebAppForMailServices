As stated on jython.org, kaffe and other Java-VM's only implementing the
PersonalJava subset are (at least) lacking java.math.BigInteger and
probably others beside of small incompatibilities (kaffe). They also 
state that it should be possible to get Jython working on this type of
VM if someone invests time on this issue.

Could this be a way to port python to a symbian device ?

Regards,
  Felix

okay, my port is just a modified python 2.3.3 source tree, with some  
modifications to make it compile under codewarrior - as i only have an  
evaluation copy of codewarrior, i'm a little reluctant to release it, but  
i could send a diff of the source changes, and we could try to make it  
work with the normal SDK build utils.

i certainly haven't spent much work on it yet, but it proves that the  
basic porting can be done relatively quickly

regards,
   paul

Dear list,

Inspired by Paul's demonstration that it would be possible to get Python
up and running on Symbian OS v7 and UIQ, I had a go myself with with a
fair bit of success. As the maintainer of the Amiga port of Python, I
already know a bit about Python, about constrained devices (and also
about being lonely in my choice of computers!).

Thanks to Paul for providing the inspiration and for allowing me to use
this list to let you all know.

This message is to let you know that you can now see that it works and
get hold of the source yourself at my website:

http://www.monkeyhouse.eclipse.co.uk/mobile/python.htm

This message is also a request for others to join in with this project.
You are all welcome, as long as you are seriously going to be able to
contribute, and you already have the necessary tools (CodeWarrior for
Symbian OS version 2.0+). 

Currently the source archive weighs in at about 13MB as it contains the
full generic Python 2.3.3 source plus the Symbian changes. Do not bother
to download it unless you have CodeWarrior for Symbian OS, honestly,
you'll be wasting your time. If you can recommend good Windows tools for
making patches, then please let me know.

There are no binaries available yet, although you can build them from
the source if you have the right tools. We are talking console mode only
and that means keyboards, so there is little that can be done on real
devices right now.

Feel free to contact me about this software.

That's all,
Tim

Great work. I've been hacking at your code for a bit; I do my
development work on Linux using command line tools, so it took a bit
of poking around to make it build.

You're indeed correct about it working on the device with a keyboard.
I have an IR keyboard, and your Python port works properly using the
keyboard - well, almost. Arrow keys and delete don't work.
Interestingly, every single thread creates a brand new STDOUT window
if it does a printf.

I have threading working reasonably right now - it works in my tests,
though the official Python tests crash it. I haven't poked deeply
enough to figure out why - I'm thinking that remote debugging would
help. I am working on sockets right now; they sort of work, and in a
day or two I should probably have a moderate incoming and outgoing
socket implementation working.

My stuff is up at:
http://141.3.25.168:8080/symbian/

In terms of how to proceed, I think that having the python executable
run a python program that creates threads with virtualized python
interpreters using code/codeop would be a good way to proceed. A
proper Symbian app would provide the UI for either interactive
editing, or for running other scripts.

For my work-related work, I'm thinking of using GapiDraw, since I
don't like the UIQ UI, and would like to work on something more
dynamic. I'd likely be writing pixel-identical bindings for FLTK or
wxWindows for the basic GapiDraw functionality that I'll be using.

A WAP request library, and phone line control code are my next python projects.

Thanks for making this work.

gopi.
